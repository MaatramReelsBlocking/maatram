# Maatram

**Action ⟹ Value**

Maatram is an open-source tool that helps students cut their own screen time — not by
nagging them, but by putting friction, points and other people between them and the app
they were about to open.

It started as a school business project at SSVM School of Excellence (class 10B, team of
five) and now runs as a live website and an Android app.

## Who it is for

| Role | What they get |
|---|---|
| Students | Timers, app blocking, study rooms, points, streaks, screen-time stats |
| Teachers | A class code, a live roster, and their students' productivity points |
| Parents | A read-only view of one child in a class they've joined |

## What it does

**App Gate + friction layer.** Opening Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Facebook, X or
Reddit goes through a gate first: an escalating points toll per app per day, a dwell timer
that doubles with each approved open in the last hour, an intent meter (why are you opening
this, and for how long), a peer veto that lets study-room members add to your wait, and a
"was it worth it?" receipt the next time you try. Walking away pays you points back.

**Hard Lock.** Pick 5–90 minutes. On Android the block is enforced natively by an
accessibility service; the lock is written to `SharedPreferences`, so it survives the app
being killed and expires on its own.

**Timers.** Pomodoro 25/5 and Deep Work 90/15, wall-clock based so background throttling
can't cheat them. Wake lock, haptics, and a power-up screen at the end of each session.

**Study rooms.** Up to five people share a room code and sync over a public
MQTT-over-WebSocket broker — no backend required. Timers, strikes, joins, leaves and chat
are all live. If someone opens a blocked app, everyone sees it.

**Stats.** Manual per-app entry, saved locally, charted per app and per week.

**Leaderboard + accounts.** Google sign-in via Firebase, real users only — no seeded
placeholder accounts.

## Points economy

| Event | Points |
|---|---|
| Hard Lock completed | +10 per 5 minutes |
| Study-room session past 10 minutes | +10 |
| Walking away from the gate | +2 (max 3 per day) |
| Opening a social app through the gate | −10 |
| Friction toll, 1st–4th open of an app that day | −5 / −15 / −30 / −50 |
| Three strikes in a study room | points reduced |

All writes are clamped to +200 / −100 per event with a floor of 0.

## Stack

Plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript — no framework, no build step. Each page is a flat
file you can open directly.

- **Auth + database:** Firebase (Google sign-in, Firestore)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Study-room sync:** public MQTT broker over WebSocket
- **Android:** Capacitor wrapper, `com.maatram.app`
- **Native blocking:** Java `AccessibilityService` ("Maatram Shield") + a Capacitor plugin bridge
- **Theming:** shared `theme.js`, two skins (neon / minimal glass), stored in `localStorage`

## Running it locally

No install, no server needed for the front end:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaatramReelsBlocking/maatram.git
cd maatram
open index.html          # or just double-click it
```

Sign-in, the leaderboard and cross-device sync need Firebase configured (below). Everything
else — timers, the gate, stats — works offline against `localStorage`.

### Firebase

1. Create a Firebase project and enable **Google** under Authentication → Sign-in method.
2. Enable **Firestore**.
3. Add your domain under Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains, or sign-in fails
   with `auth/unauthorized-domain`.
4. Publish `firestore.rules` in the console. The rules in this repo are the ones the app
   expects; the console does not pick them up automatically.
5. Drop your own web config into the pages' Firebase init block.

### Android

```bash
npm install
npx cap sync android
```

Then open `android/` in Android Studio and run.

- Add the Android app to Firebase with package `com.maatram.app` and the SHA-1 from
  `./gradlew signingReport`, or Google sign-in will fail on device.
- `android/` and `node_modules/` must stay siblings — the Capacitor plugin modules are
  resolved by relative path.
- Unzip or check out into an **empty** folder. Stale generated resource files from an older
  build cause duplicate-resource errors.
- On the phone, enable **Maatram Shield** once under Settings → Accessibility. On Android 13+
  a sideloaded build is blocked by "restricted settings" first: Settings → Apps → Maatram →
  ⋮ → Allow restricted settings.
- For sharing builds, use a release-signed APK. A debug build with `debuggable=true` plus an
  accessibility service is blocked by Play Protect.

## Tests

The test suites run against jsdom with a fake MQTT broker and per-device storage, so
multi-user study-room behaviour can be exercised without any network.

```bash
node test-roles.js
node test-gate.js
```
